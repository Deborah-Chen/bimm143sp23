## 1: Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

```{r}
db <- read.csv("PDB.csv")
db
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
gsub(",","",db$Total)
gsub(",","",db$EM)
gsub(",","",db$X.ray)

sum(as.numeric( gsub(",","",db$X.ray) ))
```

I am doing the same thing over and over, time to write a function. 

```{r}
sumcomma <- function(x) {
  # substitute comma for it to become numeric 
  sum(as.numeric( gsub(",","",x) ))
}
```


For X-ray: 
```{r}
sumcomma(db$X.ray) / sumcomma(db$Total)
```

For EM: 
```{r}
round( sumcomma(db$EM) / sumcomma(db$Total), 2 )
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round( sumcomma(db$Total[1]) / sumcomma(db$Total), 2)
# first value in the Total column
```


> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

Skipped

## 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure


> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Hydrogen is the smallest element and could not be captured by this x-ray crystalography. 



> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308


> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

> Discussion Topic: Can you think of a way in which indinavir, or even larger ligands and substrates, could enter the binding site?

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculation on PDB structures. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2 



```{r}
attributes(pdb)

head (pdb$atom)

```

Read an ADK structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a flexiblity prediction with a technique called NMA (normal mode analysis)

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)

plot(m)
```
Write out a "movie" of the motion for viewing in Molstart

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")

```
